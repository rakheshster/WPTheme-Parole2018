# Parole 2018
This is the WordPress theme used on my blog [https://rakhesh.com](https://rakhesh.com). It's a simple no-frills theme. I do not take much credit for it. This theme is based on one called Parole 2015, which in turn is based on the WordPress Twenty Fifteen theme. My tastes are outdated and I like the simplicity of these themes. :)

My blog doesn't have comments. I don't do post images or anything fancy. It's mostly text with some code snippets for which I use [this](https://github.com/urvanov-ru/crayon-syntax-highlighter) syntax highlighter plugin which is [based on an old and unmaintained plugin](https://github.com/aramk/crayon-syntax-highlighter).

I am not a CSS expert and most of the changes from Parole 2015 were figured out by trial and error. It's a good thing browsers have Developer Tools nowadays so with a little bit of CSS knowledge you can mostly tweak your way around. I wanted to make the content part of my blog wider than what Parole 2015 had and that's mostly what's different between these themes. 

## Screenshot
In case I change my blog theme some day and there's no screenshot to record what this theme looked like...
